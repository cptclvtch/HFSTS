In order:

1. Make requirements less dumb
  Every design requirement or constraint must be tracked down to it's creator. For the sake of accountability.

2. Try very hard to delete parts or processes
  If you are not occasionally adding things back in, you are not deleting enough.

3. Simplify or optimize

4. Accelerate cycle time

5. Automate

If production line works well, remove tests in between steps and only leave tests at the end.
