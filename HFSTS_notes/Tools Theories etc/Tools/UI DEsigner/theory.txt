Goals:
- Anticipate the users intent
- tracking user intention when mapping out UI flow is important
    (for example, cursor auto-snapping shouldnt be happening when the user is doing something else,
    like panning or zooming a view)

Theories:
    UI design should start from the needed functionality
    The functionality expands the design space.
    The limitations stifle that expansion.
    Examples of limitations:
    - available interaction modalities
    - available designed widgets
    - Human Model
    -
