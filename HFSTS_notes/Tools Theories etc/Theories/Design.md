Good design is synergetic and efficient

Goals require effects (necessities)
Goals can share required effects
Solutions output effects
The effects of a solution can be positive/neutral/negative relative to a goal

Solutions can contain goals.

Goals and Solutions should be matched based on common effects, in a way that is most synergetic (most amount of common effects) and effective (least amount of neutral/negative effects).

A solution is a completed prototype.
A prototype is a solution in progress.

-------
How to deduce effects from goals?  
  
If the goal is a feeling, then the feeling is the effect.  
  
If a goal is trying to achieve a meaning higher than feelings:  
1. Ask what

Circular designs are more synergetic.
