Procedural Narrative Generation:
The bridge that connects simulations and authored stories.

Definition:
Any automated process that creates a narrative over time, where the narrative is not determined before the process begins.

---
Theory:
A story is a traversal of the possibility space of its state.

Designer -> [initial state, interaction rules, desired states(beats)] -> story generator -> response <- action - player

Interaction rule: is a branching state change, with optional state requirements

From the system's pov, the player is just another character (mostly). Players need to change the state of the world using interaction rules. An indirect implementation achieved through wrappers is necessary.

Interaction rule builder?

1) create simulation with interaction rules, initial state, characters and no players. (Simulate from the point of view of characters? )
	1) create interaction rules
		1) generated by characters, items, locations
	2) create character struct
2) add beats
3) add player as a character wrapper/overwriter
4) (optional) add optimizations`

Writer:
- desired states (beats)
- 

Player:
- initial states
- desired states (beats)

Character:
- initial states
	- physical 
	- psychological (eg: forgiving, calm, anxious)
	- social
- desired states (beats)

How can lying be implemented with this system?
Is the writer an invisible character?
