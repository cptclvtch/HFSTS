In order to review the effectiveness/completeness of a solution system, it is necessary to look at a product from the point of view of an intended goal.
A product can also be reviewed from other points of view as well, since users pick their own points of view.

In order to make such a review, it is necessary to first filter out all the solutions that don't accomplish a certain goal.

   Filtering from multiple points of view can also reveal the [[Synergy]] in the system, with common solutions creating the synergy.

After filtering, a goal-solution review is necessary.
