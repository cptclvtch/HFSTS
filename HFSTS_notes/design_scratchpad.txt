- community focused (Reddit / Facebook inspired system)
- self programmable
- projects created using self contained modules (IDE)
- interprets code files
- The product and the IDE make up a single program (HFSTS) during development. On shipping, the IDE severes itself from the bundle, leaving only the CORE and tagged files
- interpreter transparency - have interpreter be a representation of it's implementation (same for IDE) [questionable]
-----------------------------------------------

- Hephaestus is divided into 2 areas: included and not included in the product.

   CORE is included in the product by default, IDE and PRODUCT files can be included by the user.
   
  CORE is not a code file but the binary implementation for the interpreter, and cannot be modified by the user.
  
  A different CORE implementation for every platform.

Random Ideas:
- Each node context should be associated with a "hat"/outfit, and when changing contexts, "Clippy" should change "hats"

- make the app feel like the physical representation of an engineers drawing table
